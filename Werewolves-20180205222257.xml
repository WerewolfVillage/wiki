      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8997">'''The job of the moderator is to make sure everyone has fun.  To that end I wanted to share the guidelines I use that have given me the best results.'''

== Day Rules ==
* Each day should last no longer than 10 minutes (excluding trials), until there are less than 10 players at which point the day time limit should be about as long as there are players (E.g. when 3 players remain then day only lasts 3 minutes).  This builds excitement, keeps things moving, shows respect for the dead and minimizes wait time to play again, and doesn't disadvantage the night active teams, but still allows enough time for the village to have good discussions.
* A player can nominate as many players as they want at one time, but a player can not be nominated or seconded by any player who already nominated or seconded them that day (unless there are 4 or fewer players remaining).
* For large villages: Kill required every day. Village has up to two trials.  If they run out of time, or use up both trials without killing anyone, then mob is allowed 60 seconds and then does a blind point. This keeps game moving and builds excitement.  The extra 60 seconds ensures that anyone accused during the last defense are themselves allowed time to defend against accusations.
** In a blind point any ties for majority will all die.  If you vote for yourself or not pointing at living player, you die (and can't win even if your team wins).  If all living players die in a blind point then they all lose, and those who dies honorably before them win, regardless of team.
** If you opt for &quot;survivor method&quot;, aka &quot;circle of trust&quot;, then last person who survived a trial begins the circle and is considered safe.
For large villages: Kill required every day. Village has up to two trials.  If they run out of time, or use up both trials without killing anyone, then no one dies during the day.
* In a trial, the accused is allowed 2 minutes for defense while the overall day timer is on pause.  They may choose to let others speak if they want.
* Voting is done simultaneously, with hand raised above head for life and not raised for death.  
* When the kill of the day is made the village is allowed to see the final votes and have brief emotional reaction but then goes to sleep with no further discussion.
* Day kills have card revealed.  Night kills are not revealed.  Kills are considered night kills if player was targeted at night ([[Vampire]], [[Cupid|Lovers]], [[Hunter]], etc.).  
* If multiple ways to die at night, how a player died is not revealed (except vampire bites on first nomination).
* First player to die has option to become a fading ghost, who continues to play for 2 more days but can not nominate, second, or vote.  They must close their eyes at night and lose any power they had.  If multiple players die on first day, they all become fading ghosts.
* Whispering is allowed, but only to your nearest living neighbors (fading [[Ghost]] is not living).

== Night Rules ==
* Night active killing roles must attempt to kill every night.
* Night active killing roles may target themselves.
* Night signaling (non-verbal communication when eyes closed) is not allowed and offenders should wake up dead with the other victim(s) without explanation (and unable to win).  Even [[werewolf|werewolves]] with unique roles should not communicate other than choosing a target, or else kill attempt fails that night.

== Player Etiquette ==
* No insults, condescending remarks, or calling a players choices &quot;stupid.&quot; Find other ways to persuade. 
* No telling people how they should have played better at the end of the game unless they are okay with that.
* Be aware if you are regularly interrupting people or dominating the conversation. Make sure everyone has equal time to speak and be heard if they want it, and no one gets ignored.  
* It's good to be silly, but try not to be obnoxious or make the game stall.  
* Have a designated area for talking when you are not playing.  Even a few people talking quietly near a game in progress can be distracting.
* If you die and want to watch, move your seat outside the circle so living players don't get confused.

== Moderator only ==
* Only interject to be a timer, to facilitate trials once someone is seconded, to answer rules questions, to remind people of etiquette, and a little story telling flourish here and there ;)  
* Do not offer strategy advice to the [[:Category:Villager Team Roles|village team]].
* Do not try to clear up misstatements from players that might be intentional deception.
* Use a notepad to write down everyone's role (and any targets), and put roles in night call order that makes sense.  Status changing roles ([[Cursed]], [[Dream Wolf]], etc.) are called last to be informed if a night kill changed their status.
* Beginning of set-up, when eyes closed, moderator should ask if anyone does not understand their role to raise their hand so all roles can be reviewed.  At end of set-up, before waking everyone, the moderator should ask if anyone was overlooked to raise their hand so they can be called.
* Continue to pretend to do night actions for any players who were killed but not revealed.
* If someone accidentally flips their card the players take a vote to continue or re-deal.
* Announce warnings for blind point in 5 min, 3 min, 60 sec, 30 sec, and count down final 10 seconds.
* Before a player begins their defense, inform the village who nominated and seconded, how much time they have if the vote is to live, let them know if they are allowed another nomination or just 60 seconds and blind point, and ask the accused if they want interrogators to raise their hands or if they prefer open forum when people can interject, but accused can demand the floor and if anyone continues to talk they will die instead of the accused.
* At night, make werewolves (or any night active group) have one player pointing at target and all others approving with thumbs up so you can quickly and accurately know the target.
* When providing information at night ([[Seer]], [[Aura Seer]], [[Sorcerer]], etc.), confirm specific target, then check your notes before responding, even if you know.  This prevents mistakes and makes it hard to infer something about the people near the target.
* At night, use misdirection so the village can't use the information.  Sometimes look at the person and sometimes look away when talking to them so they can't infer anything from direction of your voice, pretend to make mistakes and fix them or act like players are taking too long, and vary use of gender pronouns.  This will give you cover if you actually do make a mistake and need to fix it ;)

== Village Design and Role Clarifications ==
* Ensure village does not have easy victory one first day by revealing all roles and killing all players when multiple claim a single role.
* Each team should have an equal chance of winning.  Single player teams that need to be alive at end of game to win ([[Chupacabra]], [[Blob]], [[Hoodlum]], [[Nostradamus]], [[Lone Wolf]], etc.) should not be able to be killed at night, or get some other compensation.  
* If there are more than 9 players and only 2 werewolves, on set-up night werewolves choose a non-werewolf to be a &quot;[[Mystery Lycan]]&quot; who appears as werewolf to seer (Mystery Lycan does not know they were selected and does not join werewolf team). Mystery Lycan is also good compensation for the werewolves if the seer is allowed a vision on set-up.
* If Cursed is only role that would explain no kills at night, then adjust so [[Cursed]] wins with village if never killed, wins with wolves if attacked at night, and loses alone if killed during day before being turned into werewolf.  
* Bodyguard is required to protect, can not protect themselves, and can not protect same person twice in a row but can go back and forth.  Other protector roles (witch, priest, etc.) should be specified if able to protect themselves.  
* Seer can only see those that appear as werewolves (not other enemy teams), even after werewolves are eliminated.
* Bloody Mary should have eyes closed at night when any player is making choices, since they can't kill anyone protected and they might waste a kill if they target someone who is already targeted for death. 
* Maximize information available on first day: [[Seer]] and [[Sorcerer]] allowed view on set-up. [[Hoodlum]], [[Nostradamus]], and [[Cupid]] make their special role choices on set-up. Moderator should announce Nostradamus' prediction on first day.  Cupid should be allowed to pick themselves as one of the lovers.
* Diseased affects any player that attacks them with their mouth ;)
* Give a first warning, then kill anyone who violates the sacred law of love (nominates, seconds, or votes for their lover to die), the sacred law of the [[Mason]]s, the spell of the spell caster, the eagerness of the [[Teenage Werewolf]], etc.  For funsies, when a Mason dies show everyone the card and tempt announce that a plain villager has died.</text>

== Description == 
* If it is important for a role to reveal, and there are two or more special roles where one is a valuable [[Werewolf]] target and the other is not, each role can do an [[Ambiguous Reveal]].  Both players claim to be one of two special roles without saying which.  This makes it more difficult for the wolves to determine which is which, but reduces the number of good targets for elimination for the village.  If a third person claims to be one of the two roles, then everyone knows one of the three is lying (and the other two know that one of the others is lying, and [[Seer]] should check them.  
** &quot;I am either the [[Seer]] or the [[Diseased]].&quot;
** &quot;I am either the [[Seer]] or the [[Sorcerer]]. If I'm the Seer, ___ is a Werewolf.  If I'm the Sorcerer, ____ is the Seer.&quot;  Note that the second person mentioned will know you are the [[Seer]].
** &quot;I am either the [[Seer]] or the [[Beholder]]. And if I'm the Seer, this is what I know... (assuming that [[Seer]] was able to secretly communicate to the [[Beholder]].&quot;  
* Since often wolves will just target one, then the next, it can be a good option if a trusted [[Whisper Campaign|Fake Seer]] does this instead of the real [[Seer]]
* This will conflict with [[Protected Seer]] strategies, since the protector might protect the wrong person.

== Description ==
* [[Angry Mob Method]], is a Candidate Selection Method where players select a candidate by pointing at them, and when one person has the threshold number of points on them they are eliminated.
&lt;br /&gt;

== Moderator Considerations ==
* Moderator must specify [[Voter Timing: Simultaneous, Ordered, or Spontaneous]]
* Moderator must specify if threshold number of points at a player to determine elimination. This can be an arbitrary number (e.g. 4 points), most points, absolute majority, or plurality.
** If no player meets threshold, moderator must specify alternate threshold or specify that no one is eliminated.
** If multiple players meet threshold, Moderator must specify if there is a run-off vote, a re-vote, or if they are all eliminated.
** If all players meet threshold, moderator must specify if there is a run-off vote, a re-vote, or if there is &quot;dishonorable mass suicide&quot; where the game ends and all players lose except those who died honorably before them, regardless of team.
&lt;br /&gt;

== Simultaneous Mob ==
* At end of day, or after maximum number of nominations is exceeded, all players simultaneously point to their desired candidate for elimination.
* Moderator must specify if players [[Vote Blind or Visible]] (e.g. Blind Point)
&lt;br /&gt;

== Spontaneous Mob ==
* Throughout the day, players may spontaneously point to their desired candidate for elimination until threshold is met or time runs out.
* Moderator must specify how players distinguish between accusatory pointing vs. a locked-in vote (often by pointing with one arm and bending the other arm 90 degrees at the elbow with hand in air)
&lt;br /&gt;

== Ordered Mob ==
* At end of day, or after maximum number of nominations is exceeded, each player points to their desired candidate for elimination.  This starts with one player and then continues one-at-a-time until all players have voted.
* Moderator must specify start player. For example, the last player to the right of the last player to die or [[Sheriff]]
* Moderator must specify order. For example, clockwise.
&lt;br /&gt;

== Description ==
* Picks a distinct pair of lovers for every 6 players. Just as with [[Cupid]], if one lover dies, the other immediately dies of heart break. 
* Wins if at least one pair is still alive when any other team wins, even if [[Aphrodite]] is dead. Loses and dies when all lovers are dead.

== Description ==

* Choose a player each night to see if that player is not a Werewolf or plain Villager.

== Alternate Description ==

* The Aura Seer learns whether the targeted player is on the village or werewolf ''team''. This is best used when there are a significant number of supplemental roles on the werewolf team, such as a [[Minion]] or [[Sorcerer]].

== Moderator Guidelines ==

Because some roles can change over time, the moderator must carefully track roles that can switch teams, such as [[Cursed]] or [[Drunk]], and explain to the players beforehand that the Aura Seer's visions might not be consistent.

* When being voted on for elimination during the day, the [[Beggar]] may beg for their life.  If the person who nominated them votes to live, then all other votes are ignored and they live, however the [[Beggar]] must show gratitude and vote the same as their nominator for the rest of the game or else die.

== Official Description ==

The first night, the [[Beholder]] is shown who the [[Seer]] is.  Using this information wisely is key to being a successful [[Beholder]].  The most important thing to remember is that the [[Seer]] doesn't want to be found out, but if they know there is a [[Beholder]] in the game, they will try to communicate what they know to that player.  The Seer may say &quot;I don't trust Bobby,&quot; and that could be a clear indicator that Bobby is a [[werewolf]].  However, keep in mind the [[Seer]] only gets to view one player per day, so it might be the case that they really don't trust Bobby, but don't have any additional information about him.
&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Beholder]] might want to try to secretly convey to the [[Seer]] that they are the [[Beholder]], but this can be perilous... if a [[Werewolf]] catches you then the [[Seer]] might be next to go!

== Description ==

* Every night, the next living player to the right of The Blob is absorbed by The Blob.  When all living players are absorbed The Blob wins.
* Players aren't made aware when they have been absorbed, and they do not join the Blob's team.  


== Moderator Must Specify ==

* Does absorption happens before or after night kills (as the former could result in a night of no absorption)?
* Are players protected from absorption if they are protected kills at night?
* Does The Blob need to be alive in order to win, and if so is The Blob immune to night kills?
* Does the game end when the Blob wins, or does the game continue and their win condition is independent of other teams winning?
* When The Blob wins does that cause all other teams to lose, or can the Blob can share victory with other teams?
* If [[Insomniac]] is in the game, is The Blob considered to a character that wakes up at night?

== Description ==

* Each night, choose a player who cannot be eliminated that night. The Bodyguard provides no protection during daytime lynchings.

: Because a [[Vampire]]'s attack has a delayed effect, the Bodyguard cannot protect against it.

: The village should be explicitly informed before play starts about any restrictions on who can be protected each night. Typically: every night one player ''must'' be protected; no player can be protected two nights in a row; and the Bodyguard may not protect themself.

== Role Interactions ==

The moderator must be aware of nighttime interplay between the Bodyguard and other special characters. 

* For example, if the Bodyguard is protecting the [[Werewolf|Werewolves']] target, does a [[Witch]] still perceive this attack and thus possibly duplicate the effort by ''also'' saving that player's life.

* If there are other roles in the game that can kill at night (e.g., Witch, [[Chupacabra]]), the moderator must consider and explain what effect the Bodyguard has on their targets.

== Official Description ==

* When the [[Bogeyman]] is in play, the werewolves need to decide quickly on a target; if they don't they fall asleep and the [[Bogeyman]] is able to choose a player to eliminate (with no time restriction).  The [[Bogeyman]] wins if all the players who wake up every night are eliminated.
* When the werewolves are eliminated, the [[Bogeyman]] eliminates a player every night.  The [[Bogeyman]] must be eliminated in order for the village team to win. The [[Seer]] sees the [[Bogeyman]] as a [[Villager]].
* The moderator should decide the time limit, anywhere from 5 seconds to a minute, depending on the group. The moderator can decide if he wants to tell the werewolves they have exceeded their time limit or not, potentially surprising the werewolf players when the eliminated player is revealed in the morning.
* The [[Bogeyman]] can be woken up every night by the moderator, or just when the werewolves are taking too long.  The [[Bogeyman]] is an excellent role to introduce when games are dragging, or if you have a particularly clever group that takes a long time to decide night actions.
* Alternate: Extend the [[Bogeyman]] to all nighttime waking characters.  If any of those players take too long, then the [[Bogeyman]] gets an extra elimination (sometimes more than one a night).
* 2nd Alternate: [[Bogeyman]] gets an extra elimination if the village fails to lynch during the day.

== Description ==

* A break-point day is one in which defeat is ensured for the village if they do not choose the right player to eliminate.  There are two types:
** Break-Point Known:  Village can be certain when they have a day that they must choose correctly.
** Break-Point Unknown:  Village can not be certain, however moderator and perhaps other teams can be certain that if a villager is eliminated (or no one is eliminated) then victory is guaranteed for Werewolf, or other team.  Once selection is made, it is no longer necessary for moderator to continue the game and victors can be announced.
&lt;br /&gt;

== Strategy ==

* Knowing when the break-point day will be can inform a strategy an [[Everyone Out of the Pool]] strategy, where everyone reveals their role. The closer to break-point, the more valuable information becomes and may off-set the value of hidden roles.

== Description ==

*  The Vampire (original concept from Kent L Brisby): The Vampire creates yet another new rival group that strives to dominate the village. Every night, the main vampire, Vampire #1, chooses one other villager to bite and drain of blood. That villager is now a pre-vampire. The second night, Vampire #1 again bites and sucks the blood from that same villager/pre-vampire. Now with two bites, that pre-vampire becomes a new vampire, Vampire #2, and after two nights and days, there are now two vampires in the village. On the third night, both vampires each choose separate villagers to bite and suck blood from, creating two more pre-vampires. On the fourth night, the two vampires again attack their pre-vampires turning them into Vampires #3 and #4. Note that after four nights and days, there are now four vampires in the village.
 
 
If unchecked, the vampire population continues to double every two nights. If Vampire #1 is killed by the werewolves or villagers (assuming they're all using wooden stakes), all other vampires die with him, since they all came from his lineage. If Vampire #2 dies, then only those vampires created by him and his lineage die with him. The other vampires created by Vampire #1, and Vampire #1 himself, continue to &quot;live&quot; on and spread vampirism. Werewolves and vampires can attack and kill each other, with the victory going to the attacker. (A single bite from a vampire will kill a werewolf.)
 
 
If a vampire dies before putting a second bite onto his intended pre-vampire, that pre-vampire continues to live as a villager. That pre-vampire however may still become a vampire if yet another vampire puts a bite onto that pre-Vampire, since that villager will have received two bites. Unlike the zombies and werewolves, to win, the vampires must convert everyone in the village into vampires. Merely outnumbering the other groups and declaring a victory does not insure a vampire victory because all the vampires could easily die if Vampire #1 were killed, and there are many scenarios where that can happen by a seemingly outnumbered village. For the villagers to win, they must kill off all the vampires; just like they must kill off all werewolves.
 
 
The Vampire works best with a village of 13 or more players. (If using the Vampire with 12 villagers or less, consider allowing only one bite from Vampire #1 on the first night to create Vampire #2, otherwise it might take too long for the vampire population to grow to any influence within the village.)
 
 
After a pre-vampire is converted into a vampire, the Moderator will tap the new vampire so the new vampire can open his eyes and see the parent-Vampire that sired him. In this way, new vampires see their parents but not their grandparent-vampires nor their grandchildren-vampires. Also, the vampires are woken at night, not collectively as a group, but as individuals, and the vampire coven does not have the group mentality or unity that the werewolves have. (If the vampires possessed a group unity and knew each others identities like the werewolves do, since their population grows so quickly, they would be too strong of a group, especially when it came to voting during the day.) It is therefore possible during the day with the vote of the angry mob for a vampire to execute his grandparent-vampire, that lineage, and therefore himself. Consequently, some vampires may chose to never vote, and that becomes a detectable voting pattern.
 
 
Unfortunately, the Moderator now has the lengthy chore of calling each vampire out at night to place their bites: &quot;Vampire #4, whom would you like to bite tonight?&quot; etc. (The Moderator should do this vampire business as quickly as possible.) Since it takes only two vampire bites to create a new vampire, if two different vampires bite the same villager the same night, that villager is now quickly converted into a vampire and doesn't have to wait to be bitten again on the following night. This new vampire is shown both of his parent-vampires and dies in their lineages if either of them dies. The vampires should help the Moderator remember their lineages as much as possible, especially when vampires die.
 
 
For simplicity's sake, do not use vampires with the Voodooist and zombies, unless your Moderator has a history of being error-free. Also for simplicity's sake, avoid the creation of hybrid vampire/werewolves, who will have divided loyalties - unless you can figure something out that's not too complicated.

== Description ==

*  The [[Mortician]] and the [[Butcher]] (created by Audrey M. Wilson, and associates): The [[Mortician]] and the [[Butcher]] are crooked villagers. The [[Mortician]] sells dead werewolf bodies to the [[Butcher]] who sells werewolf meat to other villagers. Any night after a werewolf has been killed, if both the [[Mortician]] and Butcher are still alive, and before the werewolves come out, the [[Butcher]] wakes up to identify this customer. Then he goes back to sleep and the Moderator delivers the meat to the customer by tapping the customer. (The [[Mortician]] does not have any nightly business.)
 
 
If the customer is already a werewolf, it immediately dies of revulsion after eating one of its own and does not participate in the werewolves' attack later that night. If the customer is a villager, it immediately becomes a Lycam (a half-villager/half-werewolf) and joins in the werewolves' attack later that night. (The werewolf that died from revulsion is processed by the Mortician and Butcher the following night as well.)
 
 
The Lycam is a double-agent with confused loyalties to the villagers and the werewolves. During the day, the Lycam must help villagers by voting to execute a werewolf if a werewolf is on trial (unless it is his Lover); yet he also continues to hide and protect werewolf identities. By night, the Lycam continues to wake and kill with the pack. The Lycam only wins when the werewolves win.
 
 
The Mortician and Butcher don't increase the werewolf population, but instead convert previously trusted villagers into new werewolves, swapping loyalties. When played with the [[Silversmith]], the Silversmith plays differently. After being attached by the pack, the Silversmith stays alive and isn't converted into a new werewolf. Instead the Lycam is created and converted by the Butcher and Mortician. Otherwise if the original Silversmith scenario were executed, there would be an increase in the werewolf population, since there would now be a Silversmith-werewolf and an additional new Lycam. Note, now a Lycam can be a special villager. For example: a Seer-Lycam finds out who the Mortician and Butcher are and avoids having the werewolves kill them so the werewolf population will be maintained. Also note, the Butcher knows who the Lycams are because he created them (otherwise, they'd be dead werewolves) and this is strategic information for the Butcher.

== Description ==
* Candidate Selection Methods can be combined in a single day 
** For example on a single day you could have [[Nomination Method]] and required a [[Forced Kill]], and if time runs out or no elimination happens after 2 nominations, then simultaneous vote [[Angry Mob Method]] is used.
* Candidate Selection Methods can vary across days in a single game
** For example you could let the person who died last determine which method will be used next day

== Description ==

* Often, there is confusion in the village as to a cause of death or what just happened the night before. With certain character combinations the actual happenings just can't be deduced - with certainty. As long as the Coroner is alive, the Moderator explains the causes of death and the nighttime happenings. The Coroner, however, does not actually play an active part in the game. Once the Coroner is out of the game, the remaining villagers must deduce everything themselves without any help from the Moderator.

== Alternate Descriptions ==
The foregoing Coroner variation provides valuable information to both the village team and their opponents, and is thus a fairly neutral role.  There are two more extreme variations:

* As long as the Coroner is alive, the Moderator shows the cards of all night kills only to the Coroner as that role's night action, so the Coroner is able to decide when and how to use that information in a way that is only to the village's benefit. This does require more work on the part of the Moderator, since the deceased card(s) have to be gathered during the night, or some other way of providing the information found.

* The Coroner can also be thought of as the role that allows the village to determine the roles of those they ''lynch'', and when the Coroner dies, the village loses that important source of information, benefiting their opponents.

The original Coroner was described in the article at http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2010/03/werewolf/werewolf-extra-materials/viewall

==Official Description ==

* The first night, [[Count, The|The Count]] is told how many Werewolves are in each half of the village.  The moderator should indicate where the &quot;halfway&quot; point is (across) from [[Count, The|The Count]], and tell him the number of werewolves in each half.  &quot;One werewolf...Two scary werewolves...Three horrendous werewolves... ah ha ha.&quot;
* The smaller the game, the more impact this has.  It's a bad idea to add [[Count, The|The Count]] to a game with only one werewolf (from the werewolves' point of view).

== Description ==

* Moderator must decide [[Day Time Limit]], one of the triggers to end the day and/or impose [[Forced Kill]].  Alternatively, day end can be triggered before [[Day Time Limit]] if a player is eliminated or if [[Limited or Unlimited Candidates|candidate limit]] is reached.  However, if nothing else ends the day, [[Day Time Limit]] will end it. 
*[[Day Time Limit]] can be a fixed time (e.g. 8 minutes), variable time (e.g. 10 minutes first day then 6 minutes each following day, and 3 minutes on a known [[Break-Point Day]]), or improvised time (e.g. moderator gives 5 minute warning when they sense village is getting restless).
&lt;br /&gt;

== Common Practices ==
* [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beziergames.uwtimer&amp;hl=en Timer App]
* Give warnings at set intervals (e.g. 5 min, 3 min, 1 min, 10 seconds)

== Description ==

*  The Dentist (created by Courtney Bess): By the dark of night, each night, the brutish Dentist extracts all the wisdom teeth of one villager. The following day, the extractee cannot speak to defend himself or accuse others. The extractee, however, can vote. On day two, the first extractee will be able to speak again; but the next dental victim, extractee #2, from night #2, will likewise, be mute. The Dentist may continue to victimise the same villager.

Redundant to [[Spell Caster]]?

== Description ==

*  The elder has an uncommon resistance; the werewolves have to attack him twice, on two separate nights, to kill him. The moderator will keep track of the attacks on the Elder and tap the Elder to notify the Elder of the first attack. After a second attack, the Elder will die at the break of day, as usual.  Note, the Elder will continue to die after one village vote, the Witch's poison or the Hunter's shot. If the Elder is cured by the Witch's healing potion, the Elder recovers only one life.

In order to ensure that everyone has fun, a moderator should enforce etiquette rules.

== Etiquette Variables ==

* Are insults allowed?  Are players allowed to label anyone's choices as &quot;stupid&quot;? 
* Are players encouraged to make sure everyone who wants to speak and be heard can?  Is interrupting or dominating the conversation discouraged? 
* Are players encouraged not to be obnoxious or make the game stall?
* Are eliminated players allowed to talk near an active game? 
* Are eliminated players allowed to stay in the circle, or must they leave in order to not confuse living players? 
* Are players encouraged not to give criticism or tell people how they should have played better at the end of the game (if not solicited)?

* [[Seer]]
* [[Bodyguard]]
* 5 [[Villager|Vanillagers]]
* [[Hoodlum]]
* [[Blob]]

== Rules ==

* Game ends when villagers kill all the werewolves, or when werewolves can't be out voted.
* [[Hoodlum]] and [[Blob]] win if they meet their win condition by the time the game ends, and they will share victory with either villager or werewolf team.
* [[Blob]] wins if all living players are absorbed at end of game.  [[Blob]] does not need to be alive at end, but absorbing stops once they die.  [[Blob]] can not be killed at night.
* Absorption happens at end of night after [[Werewolf]] kill, however [[Bodyguard]] protection prevent absorption.
* [[Hoodlum]] picks 4 targets and wins if 3 of them are killed during the day.  [[Hoodlum]] does not need to be alive at end to win.
* Wolves must kill every night and may kill a [[Werewolf]].

The [[Fake Sorcerer]] is a [[Seer]] strategy designed to help the [[Seer]] not get targeted by werewolves at night.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


== Description == 
* During a [[Whisper Campaign]], the [[Seer]] confides in a trusted neighbor to reveal as [[Sorcerer]] and announce that another trusted player (ideally confirmed to the [[Seer]] be an expendable [[Villager]]) is the [[Seer]] so the wolves will target the expendable villager instead of the [[Seer]].
* If the real [[Sorcerer]] comes out and contradicts the [[Fake Sorcerer]] then the wolves will think the [[Fake Sorcerer]] is the [[Seer]] and still wind up targeting a decoy.


== Alternate Description == 
* During a [[Whisper Campaign]], the [[Seer]] checks a non-neighbor and whispers to both of their neighbors &quot;I checked you last night.  I know you are innocent.&quot;, in the hopes that one is a werewolf and will think they are the [[Sorcerer]].

== Description ==
Forced Kill is a moderator choice that requires player elimination by the end of the day, as opposed to No Forced Kill where the village has the option to kill, but if they fail to kill before time runs out then no one is eliminated that day.  Forced kill has the effect of speeding up the game, as fewer players often means fewer rounds. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It also can affect strategy.  Optional Kill may mean time spent discussing if the village as a whole thinks they should kill anyone until more information is available, and perhaps making assumptions about players who support or oppose killing.  Forced kill means that the risk associated with being a candidate is bigger.  Players who are afraid to die (or afraid of potentially killing someone important on their team) may behave differently as a candidate, as well as in selecting, questioning, voting on, and general willingness to risk becoming a candidate, when they know that candidate must die.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;  
A common variant is No Forced Kill first day, but Forced Kill every day thereafter.  This allows the village to wait until they have more information (see who the [[Werewolf|werewolves]] target, give the [[Seer]] a chance to check someone, etc.) and can be a solution if players complain that a Forced Kill on the first day feels random.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== When to Force a Kill ==

* A Forced Kill is required when either the [[Limited or Unlimited Candidates|candidate limit]] is reached, or the [[Day Time Limit]] is reached.&lt;br /&gt;



== How to Force a Kill == 
* A forced kill can be done in various ways: 
# Wait until village selects two candidates and [[One-at-a-Time or Choose Between Two Candidates|force them to choose one to live and one to die]] (may require back-up method if two candidates are not selected before [[Day Time Limit]] is reached.)
# Let village select [[One-at-a-Time or Choose Between Two Candidates|one candidate at a time]] and once the limit is reached kill the final candidate selected without voting on them (may require back-up method if [[Limited or Unlimited Candidates|candidate limit]] is not reached, or if no candidate is selected before [[Day Time Limit]] is reached.)    
# Let village select [[One-at-a-Time or Choose Between Two Candidates|one candidate at a time]] and once the limit is reached the person who nominates (or seconds) the last candidate dies if the last candidate lives (may require back-up method if no one seconds the last candidate,, or if no candidate is selected before [[Day Time Limit]] is reached.)    
# [[Angry Mob Method]] vote. (always works if all players are required to use Simultaneous or Ordered vote)
# [[Survivor Method]] vote. (always works)&lt;br /&gt;

== Description ==

* The first night, you are eliminated. Communicate to the players with single letter clues.


== Alternate Description ==

* As a &quot;non-card role&quot; sometimes the first player to die is allowed to continue playing if they keep their eyes closed at night and lose any special powers, as well as the ability to nominate, second, or vote for others to live or die.  That player is called a &quot;Ghost&quot;.

== Description == 
* View someone likely to be alive by the time you plan to reveal as [[Seer]], or at least who will be alive next day, otherwise your view is wasted.  This is impossible to know, but think of likely [[Werewolf]] targets: 
** Players who everyone trusts, not likely to be killed during the day, are likely to be killed at night
** Players who have &quot;proven&quot; that they are a special role that is a threat to wolves are likely to be killed at night
** Players who are considered skill [[Werewolf]] hunters, who are good at figuring out who the wolves are and have a history for getting killed at night early on are likely to be killed at night
* Prepare for a [[Whisper Campaign]] 
** View your neighbors.  Even if there are roles, such as [[Sorcerer]], [[Wolf Man]], or [[Cursed]] that might undermine the campaign, since once those roles are known to be dead the information becomes useful.  
** View neighbors of those who die at night.  Wolves are more threatened by their neighbors and are more likely to kill them if they can be viewed by the [[Seer]] and there is a possibility of a [[Whisper Campaign]].
* View someone with many strong opinions, so if they are a wolf you can make inferences about who they tried to kill and who they tried to protect.
** Note that werewolves will protect innocent people and will vote to kill wolves, especially when they think their nomination or vote won't matter.
* Choose from a pool that is more likely to contain werewolves
** If a werewolf is killed, and it was clear that most if not everyone would vote to kill, then those who vote to save are often more likely to be villagers.  Rather than stand out as the one who voted to save a wolf, a wolf would rather hide in the majority vote and earning the &quot;I voted to kill a wolf&quot; badge that they can use in their defense for the rest of the game.  Beginners may be exceptions thinking they have to protect their partners.
** It is not likely that early on, in a village without expendable werewolves, that a werewolf will go after their partner when there is a real risk they will die.  So if the village kills a wolf, view someone other than the person who nominated or seconded them, or who provided evidence against them that turned the vote against them.
*  When you find a wolf, don't announce it right away.  Spend the day observing the known wolf and see if you can make inferences about who might be their partner and who is likely not their partner.
* View people who are hard to read.
* View people who aren't being helpful, who are wasting time, causing confusion and chaos, refuse to speak or offer opinions, or undermine the whisper campaign.
* View people who are not focused and paying attention, e.g. playing with cell phone.  Werewolves don't need info because they have all the info they need.

== Description ==

*  The Governor is voted into office as a villager with good judgment. He would be the candidate that gets the most votes, not necessarily the majority of votes. Thereafter, the Governor may &quot;pardon&quot; any one villager sentenced to death by the villagers. The Governor may only &quot;pardon&quot; one villager for the entire game. The Governor may not &quot;pardon&quot; himself. If killed, unlike the [[Sheriff]], he does not pass on his office or clemency ability. There would have to be another election and vote to appoint a new governor, if the village wants another governor. Like the Sheriff, he may nominate himself for office. Whether the Governor is a werewolf or not will influence his clemency grant, and may or may not make him a more likely victim for the werewolves or the villagers.

== Description ==

*  The Grave-Robbing Thief (created by Viki Kind, Ed You and our &quot;Uber&quot; Werewolf players): In this variation the Thief is still offered two other villager cards on the first night. If both cards are werewolf cards, he must chose one and become a werewolf. Otherwise, he may refuse both identities and wait till another night in the game to steal the identity of a newly dead villager on the first night following that villager's death. In this variation the Moderator will ask every night if the Grave-Robbing Thief wants to steal someone else's identity, fully reactivating that stolen identity and character. Example: if the dead Witch's identity were stolen and reactivated, both of the Witch's potions would be renewed as well. A dead werewolf identity may also be stolen and reactivated. The Moderator will have to again announce any activities of the newly stolen and reactivated identity and character.

== Description ==

* If you are eliminated, you may  immediately eliminate another player.

== Moderator Guidelines ==

* The Moderator must decide whether the Hunter ''must'' kill another player, or whether it is optional.

* If the Hunter is lynched during the day, the player gets to choose another player to kill immediately.  The Moderator must decide whether to reveal the role of the Hunter's target.

* However, if the death occurs at night, the Moderator must decide how the Hunter's kill is to take place.

: One option is to have the Hunter make that choice the first thing the next morning, which means the village will know the Hunter was killed in the night. The Moderator must decide whether to reveal the role of the Hunter's target.

: An option that follows a &quot;no night reveals&quot; rule would be to awaken the Hunter each night only in to inform them whether they have been killed, and to have them choose a target under the cover of darkness. In that case, it is possible for neither role to be revealed if desired.

== Official Description ==

* Every night, the [[Insomniac]] is told if anyone woke up at night sitting next to him.&lt;br /&gt;
* The moderator does not tell the [[Insomniac]] if 1 or 2 players sitting next to him woke up at night, just that at least one of those players woke up that night. If a player next to the [[Insomniac]] is eliminated, the next player over is considered &quot;next&quot; to the [[Insomniac]].  If a player next to the [[Insomniac]] is eliminated at night, he &quot;sees&quot; that player, not the player next to the eliminated player.&lt;br /&gt;
* The [[Insomniac]] player needs to be clever when sharing information he has about the players next to him, so he doesn't accidentally &quot;out&quot; the [[Seer]] or another special character that is helping the village.  The fewer special characters in the game the more helpful the [[Insomniac]] is to the village.

== Description ==

*  The [[Slut]] (or Carrier) and The [[Invalid]]: These characters are used together. Every night the [[Slut]] &quot;sleeps&quot; with a different villager, by merely pointing someone out to the Moderator. Then the Slut goes back to sleep. The Moderator then walks around the village circle announcing, &quot;If I tap you, the slut and you had a good time.&quot; The Slut does not know the true identity of those he/she has slept with. The Slut does not know that he/she carries the lycanthropy virus or that he/she spreads &quot;werewolfism&quot; as a sexually transmitted disease. (If using this character as the Carrier, instead of the Slut when playing with young children, you needn't mention the sexual component or references; you can merely say, the Carrier was contagious and spread werewolfism to someone else.) When the Slut/Carrier &quot;sleeps with&quot; or encounters a regular villager, nothing happens to that villager because regular villagers have strong immune systems. But when the Slut eventually &quot;sleeps with&quot; or encounters the [[Invalid]], the Invalid's weakened immune system succumbs, and the Invalid is converted to a werewolf - adding an ADDITIONAL werewolf to the game! Once the Invalid is converted, every night thereafter the Moderator should continue to ask the Slut who he/she wants to &quot;sleep&quot; with, so as not to tip the village to the fact that the Invalid is now a werewolf. The Invalid is intriguing because he may be transformed from a trusted villager to an untrusted werewolf. Also, in all fairness to the village, since this character creates a new werewolf, a character that eliminates a werewolf from the game should also be used, such as the Scientist.

== Description ==

* You aren't on anyone's team until one side is about to lose, and then you join that side. You only win if you haven't been eliminated at the end of the game. (She switches teams when a team is about to lose so if the last werewolf dies she becomes a werewolf)

== Description ==

*  When the Lawyer is alive and in play, when a villager is killed, that villager writes an accusatory will and leaves it in the center of the table for the Lawyer to manage. When the Lawyer is killed, all the wills are finally read out loud for the benefit of the village. The wills are incredibly relevant for those who are killed at night. (Example: The seer discovers a wolf at night, but is also killed that night. The will states 'I was the seer... the wolf is _____.)

The Leper is an infectious character living in the village. No one wants to expose themselves, so they hide at home and avoid the risk of nominating. The village must prevent the infection from spreading too far while still nominating and lynching to eliminate opponents.

== Rules ==

* Whenever a player nominates or seconds the Leper or a different infected player, the player making the nomination becomes infected (and infectious to other players). Infection only passes by nominations and seconds, not werewolf attacks, vampire bites, or other means. Players aren't made aware when they have been infected, and they do not join the Leper's team.
* At the end of each day, if all living players are infected, the Leper wins.
* If the Leper dies, the moderator should announce the Leper's death regardless of circumstance.

== Moderator Must Specify ==

* Does the Leper need to be alive in order to win, and if so is the Leper immune to night kills?
* Does the game end when the Leper wins, or does the game continue and their win condition is independent of other teams winning?
* When the Leper wins, does that cause all other teams to lose, or can the Leper can share victory with other teams?
* Is Blind Point available, or is no kill required? If Blind Point is allowed, does it cause infection?

== Strategy ==

* The Village team may coordinate to restrict the individuals involved in nominating and seconding people.
** Werewolves may respond by eating these individuals to return the village to fear around nominations, especially if no kills are required.

== See Also ==

* The [[Blob, The|Blob]] and [[Cult Leader]] also win by capturing all living players.
* The [[Vampire]] also makes the village cautious about nominations.
* The [[Sasquatch]] can put the village in a gambit between increasing infection and converting a player to the Werewolf team.
* The [[Rapturist]] who knows who the [[Leper]] is and wins if everyone but himself is infected with leprosy.

Because this game has elimination, it can be discouraging if it keeps happening to you early on and you don't get to play.  Some moderators correct for this by using the &quot;Let Me Play Rule&quot;.


== Description ==

* If you died within 1 (or 2) days in the last game, you can not be killed for 1 (or 2) days in the current game. This player's limited protection is announced at the beginning of the game.
* Another variation is &quot;same player can't be eliminated by the village on the first day twice in a row.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;


== Criticisms ==

* Offers small unfair advantage to team of protected player, especially if they have an important role.
** Can be off-set by only allowing in large villages, where a single important player is less inclined to reveal early even with 1 or 2 days of protection
** If [[Seer]] protected, and they are found by [[Sorcerer]], this can be off-set by having [[Seer]] lose ability to see until they are no longer protected. 
* Can be a disadvantage when roles that may want to be a preferred target for elimination can't be: [[Tanner]], [[Wolf Cub]], [[Diseased]], [[Martyr]], [[Bloody Mary]], [[Cursed]], [[Minion]], even a plain [[Villager]] who wants to take a fall to protect the [[Seer]], etc.
** Can be off-set by allowing protected player to opt out of protection before receiving card, or to allow to be lost if player claims any role, even [[Villager]].
* Can create a conflict if one of [[Cupid]]'s lovers is targeted and the other is protected. 
* Can create a disadvantage for [[Leprechaun]], if [[Werewolf]] target is the protected player's neighbor.
* Can give an advantage to roles that select targets, knowing which one will have at least 1 or 2 nights of staying alive: [[Count Dracula]], [[Cupid]], [[Hoodlum]], [[Cult Leader]], [[Dire Wolf]], [[Bodyguard]], [[Priest]], etc.&lt;br /&gt;

* The Magician gets to use a different nighttime power each night. Here's how it works: Before the game, the Moderator puts several nighttime-active roles in a pile (while he may reveal those roles to the players, it's better if he doesn't), and then each n

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4515">The Masons are members of a secret society. Thus they know who each other are, and can be assured that their fellow Masons are not [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] — or anything else, for that matter — and that information can benefit the village team. However, the society violently protects its secrecy, instantly killing anyone who makes a reference — even an indirect one — to the organization.

== Rules ==

* The first night, wake up to see who any other Masons are.

|-

| '''Night Active''' || No
|}

=== Moderator Guidelines ===

* The moderator should be firm about killing those that refer to the secret society, either directly or indirectly, as long as the reference is unambiguous. For example, &quot;maybe Alice can vouch for Bob but just can't talk about it&quot; would be a clear reference to the secret society, whereas &quot;maybe Alice can vouch for Bob&quot; could also be a reference to Alice being a [[Seer]] or both being [[Werewolf|Werewolves]], and thus tolerable.

* Whether the death penalty applies to whispered discussions outside of the Moderator's hearing (requiring players to inform on one another) can become an issue which the moderator should be prepared to rule on.

= Variations =

== Vigilante Masons ==

Like some secret societies who take the law into their own hands when the legitimate authorities seem unable to cope, these '''Vigilante Masons''' are willing to kill to restore order. They have the option each night to exercise 'vigilante justice' and kill one player. However, if they kill too many innocents, they are all lynched by the village as the only daytime activity on the day they are discovered. Otherwise, they are standard Masons, winning only with the village. Note that the normal &quot;secret society&quot; aspect that requires that the organization not be referred to still applies, making it difficult for the village to even discuss variations in the number of deaths each night.

* The first night, wake up to see who any other Masons are.

* In this variation, the Masons must be awoken each night and queried regarding whether they would like to act.

* The number of innocents they kill before being noticed and lynched will depend on the size of the village, and the importance of those killed.

=== Moderator Guidelines ===

* The moderator must choose the conditions which trigger the lynching of the Vigilante Masons. It might be, for example, any two innocent deaths; or two [[Vanillagers]] or any single important village role. In a larger village, it might be whenever a majority of those killed are villagers — e.g., one innocent is &quot;forgiven&quot; for each werewolf killed, but no more than that. Whatever those conditions are, they must be made explicit before the game begins. Remember: because discussing the Masons is always fatal, any ambiguity could lead to a difficult choice regarding whether to kill someone struggling with confusion.

== Evil Masons ==

This secret society is bent on taking over, and as such wins separately from the village. As with the Mafia, form their own team, know who each other are, don't kill at night and win if they are a majority of the total village and/or tied in number with werewolves.  See [http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Jungle_Republic here] also.

=== Moderator Guidelines ===

* With this experimental role, you will have to decide whether the Evil Masons appear as villagers or some other faction to any role with night perceptions.  For example, the [[Seer]] would probably see them as villagers, since they are not [[Werewolf|Werewolves]]. However, the [[Aura Seer]], in that role's Alternative Description, might see them as a separate team.

== Description ==

*  The [[Mortician]] and the [[Butcher]] (created by Audrey M. Wilson, and associates): The [[Mortician]] and the [[Butcher]] are crooked villagers. The [[Mortician]] sells dead werewolf bodies to the [[Butcher]] who sells werewolf meat to other villagers. Any night after a werewolf has been killed, if both the [[Mortician]] and Butcher are still alive, and before the werewolves come out, the [[Butcher]] wakes up to identify this customer. Then he goes back to sleep and the Moderator delivers the meat to the customer by tapping the customer. (The [[Mortician]] does not have any nightly business.)
 
 
If the customer is already a werewolf, it immediately dies of revulsion after eating one of its own and does not participate in the werewolves' attack later that night. If the customer is a villager, it immediately becomes a Lycam (a half-villager/half-werewolf) and joins in the werewolves' attack later that night. (The werewolf that died from revulsion is processed by the Mortician and Butcher the following night as well.)
 
 
The Lycam is a double-agent with confused loyalties to the villagers and the werewolves. During the day, the Lycam must help villagers by voting to execute a werewolf if a werewolf is on trial (unless it is his Lover); yet he also continues to hide and protect werewolf identities. By night, the Lycam continues to wake and kill with the pack. The Lycam only wins when the werewolves win.
 
 
The Mortician and Butcher don't increase the werewolf population, but instead convert previously trusted villagers into new werewolves, swapping loyalties. When played with the [[Silversmith]], the Silversmith plays differently. After being attached by the pack, the Silversmith stays alive and isn't converted into a new werewolf. Instead the Lycam is created and converted by the Butcher and Mortician. Otherwise if the original Silversmith scenario were executed, there would be an increase in the werewolf population, since there would now be a Silversmith-werewolf and an additional new Lycam. Note, now a Lycam can be a special villager. For example: a Seer-Lycam finds out who the Mortician and Butcher are and avoids having the werewolves kill them so the werewolf population will be maintained. Also note, the Butcher knows who the Lycams are because he created them (otherwise, they'd be dead werewolves) and this is strategic information for the Butcher.

== Description ==
* This is not a role handed out as a card. [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] identify one player to be a decedent of their star-crossed uncle. That player becomes a [[Lycan]] (appearing to the [[Seer]] as a wolf, but actually a villager) and the Lycan does not know of their werewolf blood.  Wins with their original team

The [[Neighborhood Watch]] is a [[Seer]] strategy designed to help the [[Seer]] share information, determine if they can trust their neighbors, and possibly sacrifice themselves to catch a [[Werewolf]]. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


== Description == 
* [[Seer]] checks someone other than their neighbors, then secretly confides in both neighbors as part of a [[Whisper Campaign]].
* [[Seer]] informs both unchecked neighbors what they saw, and that if they die in the night the only other person who knew was the other neighbor who will then have evidence against them.
* If [[Seer]] doesn't die in the night, then they have good reason not to waste views on checking their neighbors, and can even ask them to [[Whisper Campaign|Fake Seer]] for them.
** If they don't cooperate, then [[Seer]] has reason to suspect them, and can share this with the other neighbor, announce it, or just decide to check them that night.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Ideal Conditions ==
* Ideal in small villages no expendable [[Werewolf]] team roles, like [[Minion]], [[Cursed]], [[Sorcerer]], or 3+ [[Werewolf|werewolves]].
* Ideal when [[Seer]] is already weakened by presence of false negatives like [[Wolf Man]] or [[Minion]], or false positives like [[Lycan]] or [[Mystery Lycan]].
* Ideal when [[Seer]] is more expendable with presence of other investigative roles like [[Apprentice Seer]], [[Aura Seer]], etc.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Counter Strategy ==
* [[Werewolf]] who is put on [[Neighborhood Watch]] has options for countering
** Kill the [[Seer]], and then next day act as if other neighbor must be a [[Werewolf]]
** Kill the verified person, so the [[Seer]] has less information to offer

      <comment>James reminded me his original version had a Hunter; I'd swapped in a Bodyguard.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2135">The absence of a [[Seer]] can force players to focus their energies on making deductions, instead of protecting the Seer as that player acquires knowledge.

== Roles ==
'''Village Team'''
* [[Witch]]
* [[Bodyguard]] or [[Hunter]]
* [[Mayor]]
* [[Dr. Frankenstein's Monster]]
* 7 [[Vanillagers]]
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Werewolf Team'''
* [[Cursed]]
* [[Dream Wolf]]
* 2 [[Werewolves]]
&lt;br /&gt;

== Win Conditions ==
'''Village Team'''
* All [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] are dead 
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Werewolf Team'''
* At least one [[Werewolf]] is alive and [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] can not be out voted
&lt;br /&gt;

== Moderator Guidelines ==

* Anytime the [[Witch]] and [[Bodyguard]] are in the same game, the Moderator must decide whether the Witch might accidentally use their healing potion to save the life of someone the Bodyguard has protected, thus wasting it.

* Anytime the [[Witch]] and [[Cursed]] are in the same game, the Moderator must decide whether the Witch will perceive a night attack on the Cursed. In this village, that would unambiguously reveal the identity and conversion of the Cursed, rendering the role useless, so it is likely the Moderator should simply shrug during the nightly Witch instruction.

* The moderator must decide when and how to inform the [[Cursed]] and [[Dream Wolf]] that they subsequently should awaken with the Werewolves. (If the [[Witch]] were to kill a [[Werewolf]] with a potion of death, the Dream Wolf would need to be told to wake up.) If the arrangement of players permits it, this could be a tap on the knee or shoulder; otherwise the role would need to be woken each night for a thumbs-up/thumbs-down.

* The moderator must also decide when and how to inform [[Frankenstein's Monster]] they have accumulated new powers. One method is to wake this player ''first'' each night; inform them &quot;If you have new roles, I am showing you the card now. When I later request that role's night action, you should open your eyes and perform it.&quot;

== Roles ==

9 - 15 Players

=== Standard ===

* 1 [[Werewolf]]
* 1 [[Minion]]
* 1 [[Cursed]]
* 1 [[Tanner]]
* 1 [[Drunk]]
* 1 [[Leprechaun]]
* 1 [[Hunter]]
* 1 [[Tough Guy]]
* 1 [[Priest]]
* 1 [[Diseased]]

=== Additional/Optional ===

* 1 [[Old Man]]
* 1 [[Hoodlum]]
* 2nd Werewolf
* 1 [[Troublemaker]]
* 1 [[Prince]]
* 1 [[Cult Leader]]

== Rules ==

The werewolf and minion will wake up together, but the werewolf is the only one that can actually make kills. The hunter can fire their gun as soon as they are attacked or even fire into the air; if it is at night their target's card is hidden, but if it is during the day the target will be revealed. The priest can bless one person once per game, but not themselves. The blessing is more powerful than any form of kill, including a werewolf attack, gunshot, lynching, or even old age and will even stop a cursed from changing or the tough guy from being hit. The drunk will find out its role on the 2nd or 3rd day depending on amount of players. The drunk has all of their passive traits (such as being cursed, having a disease, being immune to night kills, being royal, or being old) but no active skills (such as blessing others, firing a gun, moving a kill, or causing a second lynching). The old man fears the werewolf team, but can relax if the hoodlum and cult are the only threats.            
 
ARAS: 
Moderator makes a deck of all cards except for villagers, shuffles, and randomly draws out cards equal to the number of players. If there are any dependent roles, swap those out again at random. If the entire village is slanted extremely far towards village or evil then re-deal. No explanation or listing of roles, reveal card after every death, only suggested for experienced players.

== Description ==

* [[Nomination Method]] is a means of candidate selection where one or more players verbally nominates someone to become a candidate for the lynch mob to kill, and once another player verbally seconds that nomination, then the person nominated becomes a candidate to be voted on by all players.&lt;br /&gt;


== Moderator Considerations ==
* Moderator should specify if a player can nominate or second themselves, for example to stop the clock and have the floor if they think the village will not kill them.
* Moderator should specify if nominations become invalid after someone else becomes a candidate, or if they stand as valid nominations if the candidate is saved.
* Moderator should specify if players have limited or unlimited nominations.  For example is each player only allowed one nomination per day, or only allowed one until someone is voted on?  
* Moderator should specify if group nominations are allowed.  For example, can one player say &quot;I nominate everyone except me&quot;?
* Moderator should specify if they must hear nominations and seconds, or accept any claims if no one disputes it.
* Moderator may want to indicate who nominated and who seconded before the defense or vote, as the village often considers this important information and may be more interested in hearing evidence from the accusers than the accused.

== Description ==

* One-at-a-Time: After each candidate is selected, they complete their defense and are voted on before another candidate is voted on.  In the case where two or more candidates are selected before moderator calls for the first one to start their defense, or in the case of [[Candidate Selection During Candidate Defense]], the moderator can either invalidate the other candidate selections, or decide that if the first candidate lives then other candidates will gives defenses and be voted on in order, one-at-a-time.
* Choose Between Two Candidates:  After two candidates are selected and both defenses are completed, village votes for one to live and other to die.  Tie can result in either re-vote, or for both to die. &lt;br /&gt;

== Description ==

*  Wretchedly driven out of the village, the Piper returned years later under cover of a false identity to exact his terrible vengeance. Each night, he &quot;charms&quot; two players (which creates charmed-villagers or charmed-werewolves), and the Moderator touches them. The Piper goes back to sleep. The Moderator asks all new and old charmed players to awake. They acknowledge each other and then sleep again.  At the instant when there aren't any uncharmed players remaining, the Piper wins against all the other rival groups. This victory could occur after a daytime vote or after a nighttime werewolf attack. The Piper does not charm himself. The charmed players still have all their abilities and characteristics. The charm is not transmitted between lovers. The charm ends if the Piper is killed.

The [[Protected Seer]] is a [[Seer]] strategy designed to help the [[Seer]] openly share information when they can be protected at night.  Usually it can protect the [[Seer]] for 1 to 3 nights after they reveal.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


== Description == 
* Someone, [[Seer]] or not, explains the [[Protected Seer]] strategy and asks for show of hands if anyone is against using it.  If no one is against it then proceed.
* Without revealing who has protective roles, discuss which role should protect the [[Seer]] on which nights.  
* [[Seer]] reveals and shares what they know with the village, knowing they can not be targeted at night.
* If the role that is supposed to protect the [[Seer]] dies at night, then they are a better option than the [[Seer]]
* Protective role on one night may choose to not protect the [[Seer]], assuming that the [[Werewolf|werewolves]] will not waste an attack if they are protected, and then the protector can provide an extra night of protection the next night.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Ideal Conditions ==
* Presence of one or more protective roles: [[Bodyguard]], [[Priest]], [[Witch]], [[Leprechaun]], etc.
* Presence of [[Beholder]] who can dispute any &quot;Fake Seers&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Counter Strategy ==
* An expendable member of [[Werewolf]] team can reveal as [[Seer]] and if any real [[Seer]] contradicts them the protectors won't know who to protect.  If they pick wrong, you will be able to fake seer for rest of game. (Make sure only to identify players as [[Villager]]s so you don't blow your cover.
** This is very risky, as village may choose right and as a bonus learn who the expendable member of [[Werewolf]] team is and [[Seer]] has one less person to check.

== Description ==

*  While this villager is alive, his mere existence incites anger in the village. The result is that two villagers are executed each day by the angry mob. In this way, unintentionally, the Rabble Rouser is helping the werewolves. Once the Rabble Rouser is dead, the village executes only one villager each day. (This is a very good character to use with a large village of 14 or more, since it speeds up the game.)

The Rapturist (a rapture preacher) believes that we have entered the time of tribulations and that [http://books.google.com/books?id=4tXWJDXiuTcC&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;ots=QR3WZz7S99&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false leprosy is divine punishment] justly wrought against the village. He seeks to spread the infection from the [[Leper]] to ''almost'' everyone. He sees himself as the sole person of virtue, the only villager who must be spared.

== Rules ==

* On setup, the Rapturist gets to see who the Leper is, much like the [[Beholder]] for the [[Seer]]. The Leper does not know who the Rapturist is.
* To win, the Rapturist must infect everyone in the village ''except for himself''. He must remain uninfected.

== Moderator Must Specify ==

* Does the Rapturist need to be alive in order to win, and if so is he immune to night kills?
** If he can win while dead, can there be joint victory between the Leper and the Rapturist if the Rapturist dies uninfected?
* When the Rapturist wins, does that cause all other teams to lose, or can he can share victory with other teams?

== Strategy ==

* The Village team may try to force a suspected Rapturist to nominate a villager thought to be infected.

== See Also ==

* The [[Lone Wolf]] must also balance coordination and eventual betrayal.

== Description ==

* Moderator must decide if a candidate can be selected more than once in the same day.  Common options are:&lt;br /&gt;
# Allowed but not twice in a row, i.e without first selecting and voting on new candidate before the prior candidate can be re-selected 
# Allowed, but not nominated or seconded by same people who nominated or seconded the candidate the first time (this rule is often suspended in rounds when the number of players makes it impossible to be renominated without the same person nominating or seconding twice)
# Allowed, but only during a [[Forced Kill]] by way of [[Survivor Method]] or [[Angry Mob Method]]
# Some combination of the above options
# Not allowed&lt;br /&gt;

There are many variables that must be decided and communicated by the moderator before the game can begin.


== Player Elimination Variables ==

* '''Day Kills:'''  Is there a [[Forced Kill]] and if so, how and when will it be forced? Are there [[Limited or Unlimited Candidates]] to vote on? Will village vote on candidates [[One-at-a-Time or Choose Between Two Candidates]] at a time? Can there be [[Candidate Selection During Candidate Defense]]? Can the village [[Re-selecting a Candidate|Reselect a Candidate]] in same day and if so how?  Will elimination be determined [[Elimination Timing|end of day or any time]]?  What is the [[Day Time Limit]]?
* '''Candidate Selection:''' How will players be selected for elimination each day? [[Nomination Method]], [[Survivor Method]] a.k.a Circle of Trust, [[Angry Mob Method]], [[Candidate Selection Method Variations and Combos]]
* '''Defenses:'''  When a player has been selected as a candidate for elimination will they get a chance to defend themselves?  If so, how will their defense proceed? Are they required to stand? Is it structured where they must call on others to talk, or open-forum? Does the candidate or moderator decide? Is there a question limit, or only a time limit?  Are topics restricted? 
* '''Voting:''' Once a candidate has been selected, the decision to eliminate is decided by vote.  How will that vote proceed? Simultaneous, Ordered, or Spontaneous?  If ordered, who starts?  If spontaneous, or simultaneously while being counted, is vote locked or adjustable once you see other players' votes?  How do you indicate a vote for or against elimination? Hands up/down, Thumbs Up/Down, or Finger Point? Vote with eyes open, or closed (Blind Vote)? Open or secret Vote? Can you vote against yourself?   
* '''Night Kills:''' Is there a forced night kill?  Can night-active roles target themselves? How will moderator handle indecision at night?
* '''Card Reveals:''' What information is revealed when you die: nothing, team, or whole card?  What kind of reveals happen for day kills vs night kills?  What rule applies if targeted at night but die during day, such as [[Vampire]] kills or [[Hunter]] kill?  What if someone accidentally reveals their card, do you re-deal? 
* '''Life After Death:'''  If you die can you still play as a [[Ghost]], [[Fading Ghost]], or a [[Werewolf Ghost]]?  How many players and under what conditions?

== Player Communication Variables ==

* Is whispering and other hidden communication, such as writing, allowed? Or must everything be seen and heard by whole village?
* Is communication during someone's defense allowed?  Is discreet whispering allowed, open forum to interrupt, or respectful silence unless you are called on to ask a question? 
* Is communication after final vote allowed?  Just an emotional reaction, or is any discussion allowed before going to sleep? 
* What kind of communication at night is allowed?  Are you allowed to talk or give signals when your eyes are closed?  What about communicating with night active partners?

== Moderator Communication Variables ==

* When will moderator put the timer on hold? During defenses and voting? To answer rules questions? To enforce [[Etiquette Rules]]?  
* Will moderator be helpful, offering strategy advice, warning on [[Break-Point Day]], and/or correcting player misstatements?  And if so, will they offer equal advice to all teams or just help werewolves?
* Will moderator be unhelpful to ensure they don't interfere and become part of the game.  At night will they avoid consistently speaking in the direction of the person they are speaking to, act like players made mistakes or took longer than they did, continue to call night activity for dead roles if never revealed, pretend to tap everyone for actions that involve tapping? Will moderator require all players to make ambient noises at night to cover the sounds made by night active players?

== Set-Up Variables ==

* Will there be non-card roles designated in set-up such as [[Mystery Lycan]]?
* When will initial decision making roles, such as [[Cupid]], [[Hoodlum]], [[Nostradamus]], [[Dire Wolf]], [[Virginia Woolf]], etc. make their decisions?  During set-up (more information/motivated behavior for village) or after first day of discussion (more information for decision-maker)? Note that [[Dr. Helgo]] must make decision before werewolves see each other.
* Will investigative roles such as [[Seer]], [[Aura Seer]], [[Paranormal Investigator]], and [[Sorcerer]] get an early start and investigate on set-up or wait until first night? What about roles that target but don't kill at night such as [[Blob]], [[Cult Leader]], [[Count Dracula]], [[Priest]], and even [[Vampire]]? Will they get an early and target on set-up or wait until first night? 
* Does set-up call order matter?  Is it different than normal night call order?

== Game End Variables ==
* How does the game end when there are 3 or more teams?  Does it end as soon as any one team achieves victory, or not until all teams are eliminated except one? Can some teams win or lose independently without causing game to end?
* Can there only be one winner or is shared victory possible?

== Meta Game Variables ==

* Are pacts between players allowed? If so, must they be announced?  
** For example, players who are frequently chosen as the first [[Werewolf]] target sometimes make a pact with each other that if one is a [[Werewolf]] to not target the other for 1 or 2 nights.
* Will the [[Let Me Play Rule]] be used, so that players who die early are not allowed to be killed early next game?

== Description ==

*  He becomes the fall guy when something in the village goes awry. If the Moderator decides that a particular day's votes are getting nowhere or if there is a tie, to keep the game moving forward, the Moderator announces, &quot;Okay! This day is over. I'm killing the Scapegoat.&quot; To ensure that the Moderator does not unfairly pick on the Scapegoat, the Scapegoat's identity is never revealed beforehand. (If using the alternative method of voting, wherein on the count of &quot;one-two-three&quot; everyone points to whom they think the werewolf is and that player is eliminated, then the Scapegoat is killed when there is a tied vote, instead of the tied parties.)
 
 
[Optional rule: If the Scapegoat is eliminated, he gets one prerogative of revenge to exercise: he designates which villagers, or villager, may vote during the next day's vote to execute. Note: by designating one villager, and only one villager, to be the executing vote of the village, he makes that Villager likely to be killed by the werewolves the following night, before that next day, since by killing that one voting villager, the werewolves will have stopped that day's vote.]

== Description ==

*  The Scientist has created an antidote for &quot;werewolfism&quot;. Every night, when prompted by the Moderator, he points to a villager whose food, drink or well water he has &quot;doctored&quot;. The Scientist then goes back to sleep. The Moderator then walks around the village circle, every night. If/when he finally chooses a werewolf, the Moderator taps the sleeping werewolf twice to notify the werewolf that he has been given the antidote. The following day, that werewolf is converted back into an &quot;ordinary villager.&quot; As a former werewolf, the now &quot;ordinary villager&quot; remembers who his former werewolf buddies were and may vote against them. The former werewolf is not allowed to officially expose all the werewolves - since the antidote imparts partial amnesia and because there is some honour among werewolves. The converted werewolf can only remember one of his former werewolf buddies per day and can only campaign and vote against one of them each day. (If his conversion leaves only one werewolf remaining then the converted werewolf has total amnesia and can't campaign against that sole remaining werewolf.) On the following day, if the remaining werewolves don't figure out then that their former werewolf buddy has turned on them, they're sure to notice the next night when he doesn't awake with the rest of the pack. In either case, the remaining werewolves should probably kill the former werewolf as soon as possible.
 
 
The Scientist is best used with the characters that create werewolves (the [[Silversmith]] and/or the [[Slut]]/Carrier/[[Invalid]] combo) so as to keep the overall werewolf population constant. Otherwise the Scientist could single-handedly eliminate all the werewolves. It is recommended that the Scientist be used with those other characters, but not required. Even when the Scientist has converted a werewolf, every night, the Moderator should continue to call out the Scientist and do his business for two reasons: 1) So as not to tip the villagers to the fact that a werewolf has been converted, and 2) There may be more werewolves to convert. The Moderator continues with the Scientist's business every night until all the werewolves have been converted, the game ends or the Scientist is killed.

== Description ==

* Sheriff's day time vote counts as two votes.
* This is not a role card is the usual sense.  It is a role in addition to a normal assigned role.
* At any time any player can nominate any player, including themselves, to be the Sheriff.  The village then votes to elect them into that role.


== Moderator Must Specify ==
* Is Sheriff elected by majority?  Or at the time someone is nominated do they automatically get elected and no other candidates are nominated (and if others are nominated, then whoever gets most votes is elected)?
* Is the elected Sheriff required to accept the position, or can they decline?
* If Sheriff dies, do they get to assign the next Sheriff, or does the role disappear until someone is nominated for the position?


== Alternate Description ==
* The Sheriff and the Village Drunk (a variation created by Audrey M. Wilson): Anytime during the day, the Sheriff can identify one other player as the Village Drunk and arrest that player so they cannot speak or vote that day. The Sheriff has a garland to put on the village Drunk (think of it as an &quot;ankle bracelet&quot;) to remind the moderator not to count the Village Drunk's vote.  The Sheriff gets two votes only after arresting someone, and this makes the Sheriff less of a target for the werewolves because it doesn't increase the total number of votes.

== Description ==

*  To kill a werewolf requires the use of silver, like the &quot;silver bullet&quot; that you may have heard of in werewolf folklore. The village Silversmith walks with a silver-tipped cane and wears several silver rings. If attacked by a werewolf, in the act of defending himself, he kills a werewolf and is severely mauled. By surviving the mauling, he now becomes a werewolf. This character is intriguing because he may be transformed from a trusted villager to an untrusted werewolf. Once the werewolves go back to sleep after choosing the Silversmith as a victim and mauling him, the Moderator taps the Silversmith twice to awaken him and notify him that he will become a werewolf on the following day and night. The morning after the mauling the moderator reveals the card of any werewolf he chooses, thereby killing that werewolf. (The Silversmith is one of several characters who can kill a werewolf - another is the Witch, using her poison. To maximise gaming fun, it is recommended to use the Silversmith and the Witch in the same game so that when a dead werewolf is revealed the next day, the remaining villagers don't know if the Silversmith or the Witch was the cause.)  When the Silversmith is converted, the victim of that night will be a werewolf, chosen by the moderator that same night, and that victim is the villager that the moderator offers to the Witch for possible restoration (see The Witch, below). Theoretically, the Witch could erroneously restore a dead werewolf, increasing the werewolf population since the Silversmith is now a werewolf too. So in all fairness to the village, since this character creates a new werewolf, a character who eliminates a werewolf from the game should also be used, such as the Scientist. Caution: using this character increases the chances of a Moderator error.

== Description ==

*  The Slut (or Carrier) and The [[Invalid]]: These characters are used together. Every night the Slut &quot;sleeps&quot; with a different villager, by merely pointing someone out to the Moderator. Then the Slut goes back to sleep. The Moderator then walks around the village circle announcing, &quot;If I tap you, the slut and you had a good time.&quot; The Slut does not know the true identity of those he/she has slept with. The Slut does not know that he/she carries the lycanthropy virus or that he/she spreads &quot;werewolfism&quot; as a sexually transmitted disease. (If using this character as the Carrier, instead of the Slut when playing with young children, you needn't mention the sexual component or references; you can merely say, the Carrier was contagious and spread werewolfism to someone else.) When the Slut/Carrier &quot;sleeps with&quot; or encounters a regular villager, nothing happens to that villager because regular villagers have strong immune systems. But when the Slut eventually &quot;sleeps with&quot; or encounters the [[Invalid]], the Invalid's weakened immune system succumbs, and the Invalid is converted to a werewolf - adding an ADDITIONAL werewolf to the game! Once the Invalid is converted, every night thereafter the Moderator should continue to ask the Slut who he/she wants to &quot;sleep&quot; with, so as not to tip the village to the fact that the Invalid is now a werewolf. The Invalid is intriguing because he may be transformed from a trusted villager to an untrusted werewolf. Also, in all fairness to the village, since this character creates a new werewolf, a character that eliminates a werewolf from the game should also be used, such as the Scientist.

== Description ==
* [[Survivor Method]], a.k.a Circle of Trust, is a Candidate Selection Method where at the end of the [[Day Time Limit]] all players are asked to stand and one player will select another player to sit down, and that selected player will name another player to sit down, and so on until there is one player standing who is eliminated.
&lt;br /&gt;

== Moderator Considerations ==
* Moderator must specify if [[Communication During Someone's Defense|talking]] is allowed other than saying who is selected
* Moderator must specify if the is a [[Defense Time Limit|time limit]] for each person to select
* Moderator must specify who will start the selection process.  For example: the person last nominated.
* Moderator must specify if the person who starts is automatically safe from elimination, or if they must remain standing until someone else selects them

== Roles ==

* 1 [[Werewolf]]
* 3 [[Villager|Vanillagers]]
* 1 [[Witch]]
* 5 [[Tanner]]s (who all know who the other tanners are)

== Rules ==

Instead of voting to kill we use the &quot;survivor&quot; method where one person starts and chooses someone to save, then the saved person chooses someone to save, and so on until only one is left who dies. Each night the Werewolf can kill 0, 1, or 2 people. Game ends when one team wins. Tanner team wins when all 5 tanners die. Village team wins when ww dies. And ww wins when all vanillagers and witch are dead. Role cards never revealed when people die, day or night.

== Official Description ==

* [[Thing, The|The Thing]] (that goes bump in the night) awakes each night and must tap one of the players next to him.  He may tap a player he's already tapped, or pick a different player (as long as that player is next to him.  If the player next to [[Thing, The|The Thing]] is eliminated, [[Thing, The|The Thing]] may tap the next player over. But each night he must tap one of his neighbors (even if his original neighbors are eliminated).
* The good &quot;thing&quot; about [[Thing, The|The Thing]] is that if he is sitting next to players on the Village team, the know they can trust him.  However, if he is sitting next to even one werewolf, it's probably in the werewolves interest to kill him off quickly, because otherwise he'll be compelled to &quot;defend&quot; [[Thing, The|The Thing]] during the day in order ot not raise any suspicion upon himself. 
* No other players may tap or touch anyone else during [[Thing, The|The Thing]]'s &quot;awakening&quot; or at any other time during the night.

== Description ==

*  The [[Vigilante]] and the [[Veterinarian]]: The [[Vigilante]] seeks justice and goes around each night shooting at things in the dark. (Then he goes back to sleep after the Moderator has noted his shooting spree.) But he has poor vision. If he chooses a villager to shoot at, he always misses. If he shoots at a werewolf, however, he miraculously always hits, wounding it. The Moderator then announces that a werewolf has been shot and wounded. Unfortunately, none of the werewolves knows which one of them has been wounded and they may be in an agitated state to save themselves. By contrast, the [[Veterinarian]] loves all animals - even werewolves. Each night the Vet chooses a villager to &quot;operate&quot; on and save. If he chooses a villager, nothing happens; if he chooses a wounded werewolf, that wolf is healed. The Vet has two chances, two nights, to heal a wounded werewolf; otherwise the wounded werewolf dies at the break of day on the second morning after being shot.
 
[Optional rule: the [[Veterinarian]] may be used with other characters that can kill Werewolves (e.g. the [[Silversmith]], the [[Witch]], etc.). For these injuries, the Vet must be provided one opportunity to choose the injured wolf from amongst the village after it has been injured, even it that includes a second night for that injured wolf.]

== Description ==

*  The player who gets this card immediately reveals himself to all the other players as &quot;the village fool/idiot&quot;. He does not speak again for the rest of the game and can't focus enough to join any debates or lead any suspicions. He watches mutely, helplessly. At the beginning of each new day, while he is alive, he may reassign his vote to another villager by pointing - that newly entrusted voter might be an innocent villager or a werewolf in disguise. If the Fool or the Moderator should forget to reassign his vote, his vote remains with the prior assignee. (So if a prior assignee is a werewolf, it is to the werewolf's advantage NOT to remind the Fool or Moderator to reassign the vote.) In his confusion, the Fool wears a ring of garlic around his neck, thinking it will repel the werewolves - when in fact, garlic is used to repel vampires. (If the vampire character is in play, of course, this garlic will protect him.) As a variation, in an attempt to control an unruly villager that speaks out too much or speaks when dead, the Moderator may instantly assign that unruly villager to be the village fool, either immediately during that game or in the next game if that player is already dead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2742">This village is torn by sectarian mistrust and intolerance, making the fight against the [[Werewolves]] especially problematic. There are three subdivisions of villagers, two of which are at odds.

The ''Innocents'' just want the Werewolf threat eliminated. The ''Zealots'' see some humans, those they term the ''Heretics'', as worse than Werewolves, and will only be victorious if all the Heretics are eliminated ''before'' the Werewolves are dealt with. Those ''Heretics'' are not as picky — they just want the Werewolves gone.

== Roles ==
'''''Innocents'''''
* [[Seer]]
* [[Tough Guy]]
* 5 [[Vanillagers]]
&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Zealots'''''
* Aura Seer — '''non-standard usage''': see Instructions
* Priest — '''non-standard usage''': see Instructions
&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Heretics'''''
* Witch — '''non-standard usage''': see Instructions
* Cult Leader — '''non-standard usage''': see Instructions
* [[Martyr]]
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Werewolf Team'''
* 3 [[Werewolf|Werewolves]]
&lt;br /&gt;

== Win Conditions ==
'''''Innocents''''' and '''''Heretics'''''
* All [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] are dead 
&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Zealots'''''
*  First, all ''Heretics'' are dead, and only then all Werewolves are eliminated.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Werewolf Team'''
* At least one [[Werewolf]] is alive and [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] can not be out voted.
&lt;br /&gt;

== Instructions ==

* The Seer distinguishes only Werewolves, as usual.

* The Tough Guy must be attacked twice before being killed; he is informed by the Moderator when he has been attacked the first time if it took place at night.

* The ''Zealot'' Aura Seer distinguishes Werewolves and ''Heretics'', versus ''Innocents'' and other ''Zealots''.

* The ''Zealot'' Priest &quot;wakes up&quot; to their role after the first Werewolf or Heretic is lynched, thus proving the existence of this evil. Thereafter, the Priest may kill nightly, but loses faith and this killing ability if two ''Innocents'' are slaughtered.

* The ''Heretic'' Witch can see the attacks of both Werewolves and Priest, and can use their Potion of Life on either.

* The ''Heretic'' Cult Leader may re-animate any dead player, but must sacrifice the life of another target to do so.  If either the Witch or Tough Guy is reanimated, their skills are reset (i.e., the Witch has both potions restored, and the Tough Guy has both lives restored).

== Moderator Guidelines ==

* Several of the roles do not match standard cards; be sure to explain the variance clearly. A handout may help.

== Experimental Village ==

As with any experimental village, use this village's [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|Discussion]] page to log and discuss playtesting.

Everyone gets 2 cards, one for team loyalty: werewolf or villager (mostly villagers), and another card that says who your lover is (find pairs of cards, like male and female seer, 2 [[vampire]]s, 2 [[mason]]s, [[Old Man]] and [[Old Hag]], etc). On set-up moderator wakes up each pair to learn who their lover is.  Then all [[werewolf|werewolves]] open their eyes and see each other.  Game begins and it is all in one day with many kills until werewolves are all dead, or the number of werewolves is equal to the number of villagers.  No one has special roles, just a lover who dies if you die and vice versa.  You must find out if your lover is a werewolf in which case you must try to get killed to win.

Everyone's a [[Cursed]] [[Seer]] (a.k.a. Thing Variant): All villagers are cursed and have their card swapped for a werewolf card if attacked at night.  However, during day everyone votes on who they want to see.  They get to do this two times.  If they see a villager, nothing happens.  If they see a werewolf, the werewolf dies and they get to go again (and again until they don't find a werewolf).  Villagers win if they kill all the werewolves, and vice versa. http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/365329/the-thing-a-werewolf-variant

== Introduction ==

The '''Village of Minions''' is a fairly large village with a small number of Werewolves preying upon them. There are, however, several [[Minion]]s working to advance the cause of the Werewolves, and anytime after a Werewolf is killed, a Minion can be &quot;converted&quot; to a Werewolf by being bitten during the night. 

Because the small number of Werewolves renders that team especially weak, for balance the [[Seer]] should not be used, relying on the ''alternate'' description of the [[Aura Seer]] instead.

== Roles ==
'''Village Team'''
* [[Aura Seer]] (however: see the ''alternate'' description)
* [[Bodyguard]]
* [[Paranormal Investigator (P.I.)|Paranormal Investigator]]
* [[Witch]]
* 6 [[Villager|Vanillagers]]
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Werewolf Team'''
* 2 [[Werewolf|Werewolves]]
* 3 [[Minion]]s
&lt;br /&gt;

== Win Conditions ==
'''Village Team'''
* All [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] are dead 
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Werewolf Team'''
* At least one [[Werewolf]] is alive and [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] can not be out voted
&lt;br /&gt;

== Instructions ==

* The [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] do not know who the Minions are. The [[Minion]]s do know who the Werewolves are, but do ''not'' know who the other Minions are. Note that this requires the moderator to wake up each Minion separately the first night to see who the Werewolves are.

* After a Werewolf is killed, the first Minion subsequently attacked at the night automatically becomes a full Werewolf. The game remains in play even if all the original Werewolves have been lynched as long as a converted Werewolf remains alive, and converted Werewolves also have the power to continue with the conversion of any remaining Minions. The number of Werewolves may not exceed the original count, however, and any Minions attacked at night when there are no Werewolf &quot;vacancies&quot; die just as any villager would.

: A way of indicating to a Minion that they have been converted is necessary, such as by a discrete tap whose function was explained before the game.

* When the night's target is a Minion who is being converted to a Werewolf, the [[Witch]] does not see the impending death. In this manner, it is possible that the Witch will have proof that a Minion has been converted, without knowing who it was.

* If the [[Bodyguard]] was protecting a Minion who otherwise might have been converted to a Werewolf, the attack does not take place and the Minion remains alive, unconverted and unaware of the attack.

* The [[Aura Seer]] sees which &quot;team&quot; each player is on, and thus can spot Minions, although cannot distinguish Werewolves from Minions.

* Because the Aura Seer receives accurate information regarding teams, the [[Whisper Campaign]] can be used. If the moderator wishes to discourage this, a [[Lycan]] can be added or substituted for a villager.

* The [[Paranormal Investigator (P.I.)|Paranormal Investigator]], on the other hand, only recognizes actual Werewolves. Minions who have not been converted to Werewolves will appear as innocuous as any villager; while any Minion who has been converted will be noticed. Because the conversion to a Werewolf take time, the P.I. only perceives Minions as Werewolves the first night the new Werewolf fully awakens to that role, not on the night they are attacked and converted.
&lt;br /&gt;

== Description ==

*  The Voodooist and the Zombies: The Voodooist raises and collects the dead, turning them into his mindless zombies, in an effort to take over the village, as a rival new group. Every night the Voodooist chooses a villager, who may or may not be a werewolf, as a &quot;pre-zombie&quot;. If that villager or werewolf is killed that night or the following day by the angry mob, that dead villager or werewolf returns to the game as a Villager-Zombie, or Werewolf-Zombie. The second night, that zombie is shown the identity of the Voodooist as the Voodooist chooses the second night's &quot;pre-zombie.&quot; The following day, the second day, and every day thereafter while the Voodooist is alive, that zombie joins the &quot;walking dead&quot; and does not speak. Being still alive and under the spell of the Voodooist, that zombie continues to vote, but can only vote as the Voodooist votes. To protect the identity of the Voodooist, the zombies are the last to vote or raise their hands in the village. Hence, the Voodooist creates a powerful voting block. (This block may unintentionally reveal his identity if the rest of the village notices that these zombies keeping voting with him. The remaining villagers should be able to deduce that they are now zombies because they were dead, but are now alive and silently voting.)  Being already dead, zombies cannot be killed again by werewolves or villagers. They only die when the Voodooist dies. Until then, they only live to vote as the Voodooist votes. The Voodooist and zombies win when they become the majority of the village.


With the Voodooist in play, dead players cannot immediately leave the gaming circle or the game.  Players must wait until the night after their deaths to see if they were chosen as &quot;pre-zombies,&quot; and whether or not they are now serving as zombies. The Moderator will inform them of their zombie status on this following night. As the living dead, the zombies continue to sleep at night when the rest of the village is asleep (and so they don't learn or reveal any nighttime secrets).
 

The Voodooist and zombies are a great way to keep otherwise dead players still active within the game. If playing with a group of 13 more, consider allowing the Voodooist to choose two pre-zombies at night as opposed to one. For simplicity's sake, do not use with the Vampire, unless your Moderator has a history of being error-free.

* 5 [[Villager|Vanillagers]]
* [[Bodyguard]]
* [[Mummy]]

== Rules ==

* Game ends when villagers kill [[Werewolf]] and [[Zombie]] (Village victory), or when no living player has brains ([[Zombie]] victory), or when werewolf can't be nominated ([[Werewolf]] victory). 
* [[Zombie]] wins if all living players are brainless at end of game.  [[Zombie]] does not need to be alive at end, but brain eating stops once they die.  [[Zombie]] can not be killed at night.
* [[Bodyguard]] protects against being killed by [[Werewolf]], hypnotized by [[Mummy]], or brains being eaten by [[Zombie]].
* [[Werewolf]] must kill every night and can not have brains eaten.
* Moderator announces who has lost their brains and who has been hypnotized.  Hypnotized person will not vote and moderator will not tell them how they voted, just the outcome of the vote overall.
* If [[Mummy]] loses brains they can not hypnotize anymore.  If [[Mummy]] dies at night, next day the person they hypnotized will not have vote counted.
* If [[Bodyguard]] loses brains they can not protect anymore.
* Day kills are not required.

== Roles ==

* 1 [[Hoodlum]]
* 1 [[Count Dracula]]
* Rest [[villager]]s

== Rules ==

First night hoodlum chooses X targets (X=village size/3), and wins if hoodlum lives to see those targets die.  Each night Count Dracula chooses a wife and he wins if he lives to see X wives and himself still alive after any day ends.  Kill required every day.

Seer's Revenge alternate:  Add a Sorcerer who wins with either the hoodlum if they are selected as a target, or Count Dracula if they are selected as a wife, or village team if neither.  Sorcerer knows both hoodlum and Count Dracula, but doesn't know which is which.   Each night, if they were not targeted in the day, may choose to revive the person killed during day, but then choose someone else to die.  Since death is not final until night, the card of person who dies is revealed at night when all eyes are closed.  There is a Seer added to village team who each night either looks for the sorcerer, and the sorcerer looks for the seer.

The [[Whisper Campaign]] is a [[Seer]] strategy designed to help the [[Seer]] share information without revealing their role to the [[Werewolf]] team.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


== Initiation == 
* One player, [[Seer]] or anyone else, should suggest the [[Whisper Campaign]] and clearly list all the requirements, and ask for a show of hands if anyone is opposed to doing it.  Once everyone has agreed, then proceed.
* In order for [[Whisper Campaign]] to work, all the following must be done. If any one requirement is ignored it is called &quot;Quiet Suicide&quot; because it helps the [[Werewolf]] team to find the [[Seer]], and it does more harm than help for the village team.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Requirements ==
* Check one of your neighbors
* If you verify someone as not on [[Werewolf]] team, they become a &quot;Trusted Neighbor&quot; it is safe to confide in them if you can do so secretly.  Let them know you are the [[Seer]] by whispering to them &quot;I know you are innocent&quot;, or something along those lines.  
** If [[Sorcerer]], [[Wolf Man]], [[Minion]], [[Cursed]], or other false negatives on the [[Werewolf]] team are in the game, it is not safe to confide in anyone until those roles are confirmed dead.  
* In order for the [[Seer]] to not stand out, all players must whisper to their neighbors.  It should be established that the first activity of the day is for all players to briefly whisper to each other.
** All players other than the [[Seer]] should whisper nonsense to their neighbors, or use the opportunity to discuss other things.
** [[Seer]] should whisper nonsense to any neighbor they have not checked, as well as those they checked that came up as a [[Werewolf]].
** All players should whisper to both their neighbors, and make sure each player is both a &quot;whisperer&quot; and a &quot;listener&quot; from each neighbor.
** If you trust the [[Seer]] or your neighbor, tell them your role.  The more information shared between trusted neighbors, the better. 
*** In the case of expendable roles on the [[Werewolf]] team, you may not be able to trust your neighbors in the event of a Fake [[Whisper Campaign]]
** All players should whisper quietly.  If your [[Werewolf]] neighbor hears that you are whispering nonsense, that helps them to know you are not the [[Seer]] (although this can be done to trick them if you can also safely pass information).
** Each whisperer should act like they have something important to say, and each listener should act like they have been told surprising information. Perhaps whisper back and forth to same neighbor.
** Since the [[Seer]] has important information, they will need to be more frequent, more lengthy, and initiate most of the whispers, offering explanations and making requests. So in order to provide cover, try to initiate more and talk longer to the [[Seer]] so they can act like they are getting information from you.  This will make you a candidate for &quot;Fake Seer&quot;
* Each successive night, check the next neighbor down the line.  If you confirm they are also safe, then tell your neighbor to tell their neighbor that they are confirmed by the [[Seer]].  This can be done for many neighbors down the line until you hit a [[Werewolf]].
** It is important not to make the pattern too predictable, so instead of going down the line on one side, you can alternate going down the line to your right and your left, so long as you don't skip anyone.
** Choose the next neighbor based on [[Good Views and Wasted Views]].  Check the one that you think is most likely to be alive the next day, or the one who will give you additional information if they are a [[Werewolf]], and don't waste a view on someone you strongly believe is on the village team.
** Once you hit a [[Werewolf]] you will need to switch sides, since information can not be passed on past the [[Werewolf]].
* When you have information about the identity, good or bad, about enough living players that the village can win the game, it is safe to announce you are the [[Seer]] and share the information with the remaining players.
** If this contradicts what another player has heard via whispering, they should announce the contradiction so the village can sort out who is lying.
** If you die, the information you provided lives on with all the trusted neighbors who can use it to secure victory.
** For an added layer of safety, a trusted neighbor can &quot;Fake Seer&quot; for the real [[Seer]].
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Fake Seer ==
* A [[Seer]]'s neighbor should have all the information the [[Seer]] has, so they can come out as the [[Seer]], share that information with the village, and be more likely to be targeted by the [[Werewolf|werewolves]].  They sacrifice themselves so the [[Seer]] can continue to live and view others.
* This could also be done further down the line with a neighbor's neighbor's neighbor, etc.  This is better, since [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] will suspect the immediate neighbor or anyone who comes out as [[Seer]] during a [[Whisper Campaign]].
** Make sure everyone in the chain of trusted neighbors knows the plan, so they don't announce that they are contradicting the real [[Seer]].
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Fake [[Whisper Campaign]] ==
* If there are expendable roles on the [[Werewolf]] team, such as [[Sorcerer]], [[Minion]], or 3+ [[Werewolf|werewolves]], etc. there is a risk that someone on the [[Werewolf]] team will claim to be [[Seer]] and start a Fake [[Whisper Campaign]]
* Fake [[Whisper Campaign]] can be undone and expose a [[Werewolf]] and the [[Seer]] if a player is confirmed from whispering from both neighbors, or confirmed from whispering on one neighbor and a player from their other side, even if not a direct neighbor (distance based on number of possible views) comes out as the [[Seer]].
* Fake [[Whisper Campaign]] is high risk in a small village when odds are high that a [[Werewolf]] will be too close to a [[Seer]], such that one person will get whispered to from both sides claiming they were verified by the [[Seer]]&lt;br /&gt;

== Description ==
* Every night the moderator will wake the whore and ask all other players to raise their hand if they want to sleep with the whore.  The whore must pick one player who has their hand raised and who they have not yet slept with, otherwise the whore sleeps alone.  Whoever the whore chooses can not be killed that night.  If the whore chooses a werewolf the whore will die, in addition to whoever the werewolves choose as their victim.  Everyone who raised their hand will not vote the next day (take off shoe or put a stone on their card).  The whore may once choose herself and give up the right to vote to appear as a patron.

== Description ==

* You may save or eliminate a player at night once each per game.

== Role Interactions ==

The moderator must be aware of nighttime interplay between the Witch and other special characters. 

* For example, if a [[Bodyguard]] is protecting the [[Werewolf|Werewolves']] target, does the Witch still perceive this attack and thus possibly duplicate the effort by saving that player's life.

* If a [[Cursed]], [[Chupacabra]], or a [[Vampire]] is the target, does the Witch perceive this attack at all, since none would actually be killed as a result?

== Description ==

*  At night the Wizard points to two players and teleports them, swapping their seating potions. When the Moderator touches these players, they open their eyes, swap seats and take their original identities and cards with them. (Being silent is not necessary because all players should notice the swap when they open their eyes.) If one of these swappers was the intended werewolf victim that night, that victim is now safe in the other swapped seat and the second swapper, the unintended victim, is now the intended victim, in the original seat or house of death. This way, the Wizard can protect other valuable villagers, such as the [[Seer]] or [[Little Girl]], should their identities become known. This way, the Wizard can thwart the werewolves' schemes. If other characters are used that involve a preselection process (pre-vampires via [[Brisby Vampire]], pre-zombies via [[Voodooist]], etc.), their identities and game play are not changed or complicated by a Wizard seat-swap.

== Roles ==

* 1 [[Hoodlum]]
* 1 [[Blob]]
* 1 [[Cultist]] (gets to know other evils but not which is which and wins if the village loses)
* 1 [[Seer]] (can detect all 3 evil)
* 1-2 [[Sasquatch]]es (start out on good team and do not wake normally, but begin killing during the night if there's no lynching).  Sasquatches need to survive to win, otherwise they'd be too likely to out themselves early and help the village &amp; seer too much.
